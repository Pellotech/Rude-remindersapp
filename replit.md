# Rude Daily Reminder App

## Overview
The Rude Daily Reminder App is a full-stack application that delivers daily reminders with a humorous, "rude" twist, allowing users to adjust the rudeness level. It transforms standard reminders into brutally honest, motivational notifications. The project, initially a web application, has been converted into native iOS and Android mobile apps using Capacitor. Key capabilities include photo/video attachments, historical motivational quotes, voice character selection, cross-platform synchronization, and rich native mobile notifications. The business vision is to provide a unique, engaging reminder experience that blends humor with motivation, offering a distinct alternative in the productivity app market.
